1. in customer table. customer_id is not required. customer_email would work as primary key
same for vendor, and govt table
2. Add db_admins table (admin_email, admin_password, admin_name)
3. in promotions table, added promotions_id as primary key. primary key was previously a composite key of customer_id and vendor_id which wont always be unique so added this.
